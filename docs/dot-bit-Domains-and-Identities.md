`.bit` domains and public identities are currently stored in the Namecoin P2P network. It's very similar to the Bitcoin network.

All of this must currently be done using `namecoind`, a daemon that DNSChain requires running in the background to access the Namecoin network.

See the [Namecoin wiki](https://github.com/namecoin/wiki/wiki) for more info:
